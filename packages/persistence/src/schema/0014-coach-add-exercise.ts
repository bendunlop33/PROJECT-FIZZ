/**
 * Schema version 14: the coach's `add_exercise_today` (12 Oct). Frozen once
 * released.
 *
 * - `coach_actions.kind` gains `add_exercise_today` (an exercise added to
 *   today's workout because Ben asked; the row and its record are written in
 *   one transaction through the workout's own `add_exercise` command).
 *   SQLite can't alter a CHECK, so the table is rebuilt with the same
 *   columns, rows, indexes and trigger, as migrations 7, 11, 12 and 13 did.
 *   The CHECK keeps 13's kinds.
